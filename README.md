# Text-Analysis-on-Customer-reviews-of-Amazon-Products
The objective of this report is to firstly understand the trend of the reviews over time, analyze the sentiments present in the reviews and 
the rating, and then further perform topic modeling on the customer reviews for the top three products. Our dataset consists of columns such as 
customer reviews, ratings, date details which we got for  Amazon products.  We started with sentiment analysis for the customer reviews to understand 
the customer perception of the products being reviewed. Next, we checked if there is any difference in the customer reviews, ratings and average polarity 
in the initial 90 days vs after 90 days, this helped us gain more insights as to if the customer reviews were biased in the initial 90 days . 
We performed hypothesis testing to check the statistical significance of the values obtained. Finally, we carried out topic modeling to understand the 
underlying semantic structure in the customer reviews.
